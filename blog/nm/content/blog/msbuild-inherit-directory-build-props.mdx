Microsoft Build ("<abbr title="Microsoft Build">msbuild</abbr>") now ships the
feature where special project root files **Directory.Build.props** and
**Directory.Build.targets** are applied for all the projects discovered in
inherited folders.

By default, once msbuild find one file with each suffix, it stops processing
all ancestor folders for additional files with the same name. Thus nested or 
inherited Directory.Build.x files are not supported out of the box. 

To enable nested or inherited Directory.Build.x the `<Import />` directive 
must be used in child files.  The [msbuild documentation][ms-docs] covers
how to do this without notating that the `<Import />` directive must be
within the `<Project></Project>` element which may be confusing if you're
just starting to dig into customizing msbuild projects.

## Single Level Example 

Lets say you want to enable different build properties for **src** and **test**
directories for your project as outlined below for different Rosalyn analyzer
rule sets:

- project
  - Directory.Build.props  
  - src 
    - Directory.Build.props
    - ProjectA 
  - test 
    - Directory.Build.props 
    - ProjectA.Tests 

In Directory.Build.prop files in the child directory, the key item to add is 
the `<Import />` directive inside the `<Project>` element with an 
`[MsBuild]` function to get the file path of the ancestor folder above the
current directory. 

Functions in msbuild projects are called similar to static functions in PowerShell,
with the type wrapped in square brackets followed by a double colon and then 
paren with arguments e.g. `[Type]::Method('arg1', '$(BuildProp1)')`

```xml
<Project>
   <Import Project="$([MSBuild]::GetPathOfFileAbove('Directory.Build.props', '$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)../'))" />
</Project>
```

Once the above is set, you can import the base props or target file(s) and add 
any overrides or addition properties for the child file.  

```xml
<Project>
	<Import Project="$([MSBuild]::GetPathOfFileAbove('Directory.Build.props', '$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)../'))" />
	<PropertyGroup Condition="$(Configuration) == 'Release'">
		<CodeAnalysisRuleSet>$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)../nm-release.ruleset</CodeAnalysisRuleSet>
	</PropertyGroup>

	<PropertyGroup Condition="$(Configuration) == 'Debug'">
		<CodeAnalysisRuleSet>$(MSBuildThisFileDirectory)../nm-debug.ruleset</CodeAnalysisRuleSet>
	</PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```
